## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**YiiiLiu/YiiiLiu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a night market research project.
- ğŸŒ± I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Management Science and Engineering at the University of Waterloo. My courses focus on operations research and data analysis. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics with a concentration in data analysis and a minor in Statistics from Simon Fraser University.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am learning snoboarding right now and it is kinda hard...
