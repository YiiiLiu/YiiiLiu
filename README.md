 Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a night market research project.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Management Science and Engineering at the University of Waterloo. My courses focus on operations research and data analysis. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics with a concentration in data analysis and a minor in Statistics from Simon Fraser University.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am learning snoboarding right now and it is kinda hard...
